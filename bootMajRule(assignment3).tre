>        All characters are of type 'unord'
>        All characters have equal weight
>        478 characters are constant

>        Number of parsimony-informative characters = 550
>    Gaps are treated as "missing"
>  Starting tree(s) obtained via stepwise addition
>    Addition sequence: random
>    Number of replicates = 10
>    Starting seed = generated automatically
>    Number of trees held at each step = 1
>  Branch-swapping algorithm: tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) with reconnection limit = 8
>    Steepest descent option not in effect
>  Initial 'Maxtrees' setting = 100
>  Branches collapsed (creating polytomies) if maximum branch length is zero
>  'MulTrees' option in effect
>  No topological constraints in effect
>  Trees are unrooted
